# From Adverse Events to Recovery: Linguistic Accommodations that Keep Online Conversations Civil

**Collaborators:** Himnish Hunma _(hhunma2@illinois.edu)_ and Justin Chen _(jechen4@illinois.edu)_

This project aims to analyze the strategies Reddit users utilize to defuse tense conversations. 

## Motivation
Our study will evaluate the types of accommodations users make to effectively defuse off-track conversations, considering
both the timing and context of the interaction. In providing different conversational strategies to defuse toxic conversations and
exploring the context in which those strategies are most effective, the study informs specific types of nudges that moderators and
platforms can use in the future to help guide conversations back on track before an adverse event occurs.
## Methodology

To examine accommodations and identify potential nudges, we will analyze conversation datasets from Reddit and Wikipedia,
focusing on threads where discussions experienced a moderation outcome or personal attack. We create matches between conversations
based on the characteristics of the conversation prior to the first adverse events (termed precursor characteristics going forward) and
community characteristics, where one conversation recovered after the first adverse event, while the other did not. We characterize the
space between the first adverse event and the avoided second event as a “nudge window,” the replies within which form the corpora
for our qualitative analysis of linguistic accommodations. Analysis is performed using a Large Language Model and a 2-rater setup.
We finally fit a regression framework on precursor characteristics, community characteristics and linguistic strategies used across
matches to determine when those strategies are most effective in avoiding further moderation outcomes.

## Preliminary results
- Boundary Invocation, Community Solidarity and Humorous Deflection are statistically significant strategies that lead to conversation recovery.
- Some precursor characteristics indicate what timing of a moderation event and subsequent nudge is most favorable to recovery.
- Boosting author diversity within conversations and educating them to use these strategies can lead to more resilient conversations.
