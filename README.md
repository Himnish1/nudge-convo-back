# nudge-convo-back
This repository will contain the implementation of a Chrome extension with Convokit backend that will live on Reddit and analyze the threads you reply to. Its job is to detect conversations going awry and suggest nudges at appropriate times to bring the conversation back on track and prevent moderation outcomes down the line.
